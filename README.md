Advertising impact simulations

These are Jupyter notebooks that I hope will lead to some interesting simulations
for programmatic display advertising. The first notebooks help to visualize beta 
distribtions that we might use in simulations and start with a simple simulation
where the impact of advertising is random. I'm hoping to add more notebooks to
make the impact of advertising more dependent on
user, publisher, and advertiser attributes and add some of the impact of
search advertising.
