Advertising impact simulations

These are Jupyter notebooks that I hope will lead to some interesting simulations
for programmatic display advertising. The first notebooks help to visualize beta 
distribtions that we might use in simulations and start with a simple simulation
where the impact of advertising is random. My next step is to get time-of-day and 
day-of-week variations in activity into the simulations. Then I'm hoping to add 
more notebooks to
make the impact of advertising more dependent on
user, publisher, and advertiser attributes and add some of the impact of
search advertising.

I have a lot of thoughts about how this works that I'd like to put 
into a simulation. Different people have different attitudes which 
impact the sites that they go to. They have some sites they visit regularly
but could also follow links to other sites. The content they see 
depends on their attitudes and the site. Different types of browsing 
are different at different times of the day. Ad effectiveness depends 
on the match between the person, site, site content, and ad message. 
Social, email, influncers, and search are also part of the ad journey. 
Display ads could get someone interested in a product, but they may 
find competing products when they do research or searches. Attribution 
logs may not include some events if user tracking is limited and that 
could result in bad results depending on the type of model.
